# Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection for CT Scans

## About The Project
This project presents a novel weakly supervised anomaly detection (WSAD) algorithm for CT scans, which reduces the annotation workload while providing better performance than conventional methods. 

The proposed WSAD algorithm is trained based on scan-wise normal and anomalous annotations, unlike slice-level annotations required in conventional supervised learning. The methodology is motivated by video anomaly detection tasks.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Data

The following two publicly available datasets were used.

### 

- pytorch
- pandas
- sklearn

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
